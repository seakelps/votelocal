                        <h2>Civil Rights in Cambridge</h2>

                        <h5>Can everyone breathe?</h5>

                        <p>Across the country, young black men have a far higher risk of being shot and killed by police than young white men. The names of police shooting victims echo in our news and our national consciousness: Michael Brown. Freddie Gray. Tamir Rice. Philando Castile. Charleena Lyles. (<a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org">mapping police violence</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32740523">bbc</a>)</p>

                        <p>Different cities with similar racial demographics, population size, and crime rates do not also have the same rate of police shootings. The <a href="http://useofforceproject.org/#analysis">Use of Force Project</a> "found that police departments with policies that place clear restrictions on when and how officers use force had significantly fewer killings than those that did not have these restrictions in place." </p>

                        <p>Of course long before the bullets fly, people of color may be discriminated against in other ways: increased traffic stops, stop and frisk programs, broken cash bail systems, increased <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/09/26/where-local-governments-are-paying-the-bills-with-police-fines/">fines</a> and broken windows style policing, and unequal access to housing and education.</p>

                        <p>These are all local issues.</p>

                        <p>How does Cambridge measure up?</p>

                            <li>Does Cambridge do enough to involve residents of color on its committees and resident advisory boards?</li>
