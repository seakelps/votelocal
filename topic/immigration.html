                        <h2>Immigration in Cambridge</h2>

                        <h5>Currently in Cambridge</h5>

                        <p>Did you know that Cambridge has been a sanctuary city since the 1985? (<a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/cambridge/cambridge-officials-release-sanctuary-city-statement">patch</a>, <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V122/N29/29sanc.29n.html">tech.mit</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/peacecommission/news/2017/02/~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A53F9EFA447EC961275F28F7E2246&_z=z">recent city statement</a>)</p>

                        <p>While there is no set definition of sanctuary city, in general the term is used to refer to cities that don't allocate local resources to enforcing federal immigration policy. This can range from directing the police to not ask about immigration status, to barring police from sharing any information with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

                        <p>This term has been in the news lately, as Attorney General Jefferson Sessions (and others in the Trump administration) ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities and threatened withholding federal funding. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/27/521680263/attorney-general-orders-crackdown-on-sanctuary-cities-threatens-holding-funds">npr</a>, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/sanctuary-cities-crackdown-government-shutdown-237121">politico</a>)</p>

                        <p>Cambridge, however, has not backed down from its public commitment to welcoming immigrants. In fact, since the last election, Cambridge has:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reaffirmed its sanctuary city status (<a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/peacecommission/news/2017/02/cambridgeremainscommittedtobeingasanctuarycity">posting</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/peacecommission/news/2017/02/~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A53F9EFA447EC961275F28F7E2246&_z=z">statement</a>)</li>
                                <li>Voted that Massachusetts should "withdraw from a federal customs enforcement training program that looks to tighten immigration enforcement state-wide" (<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/3/7/cambridge-support-blocking-immigration-enforcement-training/">harvard crimson</a> and <a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=12&ID=1639&Inline=True">council meeting minutes</a>)</li>
                                <li>Appointed long-time advocate Emmanuel "Manny" Lusardi as official 'Liaison for Immigrant Affairs'</li>
                                <li>Published <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/immigrationconcernsresourcepage">a list of resources</a> for immigrant residents</li>
                                <li>Considered (again) extending municipal-level voting to Cambridge's 18,000 resident immigrants (<a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=12&ID=1625&Inline=True">meeting minutes</a>, <a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=12&ID=1626&Inline=True">meeting minutes</a>)</li>
                                <li>Continued exploring municipal IDs (<a href="http://www.cambridgeday.com/2017/03/02/immigrant-legal-defense-fund-city-ids-advance-amid-trump-era-uncertainties/">cambridge day</a>, <a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=12&ID=1638&Inline=True">meeting minutes</a>.

                            </ul>

                        <h5>Could the city do more?</h5>

                        What do you think?

                        <ul>
                            <li>Could it establish public defender funds for a Cambridge resident facing immigration charges?</li>
                            <li>Cambridge has considered allowing immigrant residents to vote in local elections for years - can the council push the state legislature <i>more</i> to finally get this home-rule petition approved?</li>
                            <li>Similarly, 2017 is not the first time municipal IDs have been explored. What would it take to make them a safe and welcoming reality?</li>
                        </ul>
