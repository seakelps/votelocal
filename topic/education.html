                        <p>Cambridge's education system is the city's largest expenditure, with a projected 2018 expense of $183.05 Million (<a html="http://budget.data.cambridgema.gov/#!/year/2018/operating/0/service/Education/0/department_name/Education/0/division_name/Education/0/category?vis=barChart">cambridge open budget portal</a>). Both the city council and the school board play a vital role in determing how much funding the schools get, the salaries of the educators, which school buildings get renovation, even what topics get taught and when school beigns.</p>

                        <p>This is not unusual! Education policy in the united states is very much a State and local issue, and even the U.S. Department of Education website reads:</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Education is primarily a State and local responsibility in the United States. It is States and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds, that establish schools and colleges, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation. The structure of education finance in America reflects this predominant State and local role. Of an estimated $1.15 trillion being spent nationwide on education at all levels for school year 2012-2013, a substantial majority will come from State, local, and private sources. This is especially true at the elementary and secondary level, where about 92 percent of the funds will come from non-Federal sources.</p> - <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html">US Department of Education</a></blockquote>

                        <p>Recently in Cambridge:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The council asked the City Manager to assess if the new Tobin School could hause half of Cambridge's 3 and 4-year-olds, towards the goal of universal pre-K. (<a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=15&ID=1714&Inline=True">may 15 meeting final actions</a>)</li>
                            <li>The city authorized borrowing $2 million "for various School building infrastructure projects including roof repairs at the Fletcher Maynard Academy, and a new boiler at an elementary school." (<a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=15&ID=1719&Inline=True">may 22 meeting final actions</a>)</li>
                            <li>The council discussed replacing the playground artifical turf at several schools. (<a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=15&ID=1644&Inline=True">march 27 meeting final actions: includes risk assessment</a>, <a href="http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=15&ID=1648&Inline=True">april 3 meeting final actions: includes public emails</a>)</li>
                            <li>The Public School system published a three year <a href="http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/superintendent/CPS_District_Plan_2017.pdf">district plan.</a></li>
                            <li>The School Board stated that no federal immigration officer will be allowed in a Cambridge Public School with a warrent or direct permission from the superintendant. (<a href="http://www.cambridgeday.com/2017/06/10/affirmation-of-protection-for-immigrants-among-flurry-of-actions-by-school-officials/">cambridge day</a>) (if you care about immigration, also check out <a href="./immigration">that topic page</a>!)</li>
                            <li>Expanded access to free feminine hygene products in Cambridge schools, with the goal of complete access by the 2018-2019 school year. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_lrAPKGs8Y&feature=youtu.be">youtube interview</a>)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>What do you think?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is Cambridge doing enough to equalize education opportunity between boys and girls?</li>
                            <li>Could Cambridge do more to end racial discrimination in education?</li>
                            <li>How should Cambridge explore bilingual education within its school lottery system? (<a href="http://www.cambridgeday.com/2017/05/23/tricky-math-of-school-choice-wins-a-look-parents-warned-theres-no-fast-solution/">cambridge day</a>)</li>
