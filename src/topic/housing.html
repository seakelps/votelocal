                        <p>Ask any candidate for city council about their priorities for the city and you’re likely to hear something about affordable housing and development. A perennial subject of debate in Cambridge politics, the issue of housing includes the complicating factors of university housing, a booming tech economy, and the space limitations of any urban environment. A new apartment building can signal positive signs of growth or unwanted gentrification, depending on your perspective.

                        <h5>By the numbers</h5>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>More than 30% of Cambridge residents attend school full- or part-time, with more than 6,000 students living in off-campus housing</li>
                            <li>The median income is over $100k, but 14% of individuals and 9% of families live below the federal poverty line</li>
                            <li>In the last 20 years, Cambridge has seen population growth at the highest income levels (7.5% increase/year) while losing middle-income residents (6% decrease/year)</li>
                            <li>Median monthly rent citywide is over $3,000/month, and homes sell for over a million</li>
                            <li>The Cambridge Community Development Department administers affordable housing programs for renters and buyers, but wait times are unpredictable and can be long</li>
                            <li>In April 2017, the Cambridge city council voted unanimously to increase the required amount of affordable units in new development from 15% to 20%</li>
                            <li>Sources: <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2017/6/~/media/15C81E4E20BA4B31B37B7521D1DA3A2C.ashx">Cambridge Housing Profile 2016</a>, <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2017/4/inclusionaryhousingzoningordinanceapproved.aspx">Community Development Department News</a>

                        <p>Cambridge faces high housing prices as demand and local incomes rise, which can price out long-time residents. Possible changes to the current system attempt to address both the supply and demand sides of this equation. Graduate students at MIT filed a petition in August 2017 to require the university to build more student housing before developing commercial space in Kendall Square. Other proposals further change affordable housing policy, including adding middle-income programs and larger units for families. A transfer tax would penalize real estate speculators who buy property without living in it.</p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <p>Another hot-button topic around this issue has been campaign funding from local developers. Some citizens worry that taking this funding will skew candidates’ priorities when writing city policy.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>MIT students are asking for more grad student housing as part of the Volpe site development. Does that accomplish any local housing goals?

                            <li>Is 20% the right proportion of affordable units in new housing?</li>
